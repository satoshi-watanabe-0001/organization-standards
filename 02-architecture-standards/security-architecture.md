>  The traditional search has become obsolete and ineffective. As users navigate through endless ads, spam, and biased information, common activities like planning a trip, researching products, or seeking impartial information become frustratingly time-consuming. 

 Traditional search engines have long acted as gateways to the internet, serving primarily as directories that list web pages potentially containing the answers you're seeking. This approach can often feel like being dropped in the middle of a jungle with an unverified map, requiring you to navigate alone to discern which paths lead to trustworthy and relevant information. These engines rank pages based on factors like keyword relevance and site authority, but they do not necessarily account for the actual quality or potential business biases of those pages. 

 In stark contrast, Genspark, our new AI agentic engine, is like having a team of knowledgeable guides. Each guide, or AI agent within our multi-agent framework, not only knows the jungle inside out but also creates unique pathways and gathers the best fruits from various parts of the jungle directly for you, on the fly. Unlike traditional search engines that act as bridges to existing third-party webpages, Genspark agents generate new, custom pages—called [Sparkpages](https://mainfunc.ai/blog/sparkpage_intro)—in real time based on your query. These pages are dynamically generated to directly meet your specific informational needs, synthesizing content from a broad array of relevant sources. Each agent contributes its own unique approach to the search, ensuring a highly personalized and relevant experience, free from the influence of business biases and SEO-driven content.
